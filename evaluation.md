# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. YES! So glad you put time into creating a Readme and planning folder. It was really easy for me to jump in and figure out what your project was all about. Keep this up on future projects.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Love how you structured your program. You went beyond the technical requirements and made use of multiple many-to-many relationships in a way that made sense given the project scope. Next step here would be to see how additional models (e.g., Step) could help improve app organization and functionality.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. It was very easy to read through your code. Only thing I can suggest here is to be more consistent and use code comments here and there, but I had no problem parsing through your code. Keep it up, and make sure to click the link below for my inline code comments.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. While I'm still bummed that your app is no longer called "Turkey Wurkey", I'm really impressed with this application. Very glad to see that you were able to implement ingredient/amount selection into your recipe forms the way you wanted to. Let me know if you have any lingering questions about the project. Great job!
